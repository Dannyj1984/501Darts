# 501Darts

A scorer app for the 501 darts game.

The app keeps track of the score as players take turns throwing 3 darts at a time and their score is reduced accordingly. 

When a player reaches a possible finish, the app calculates possible 'outs' (a player must finish on a double) 

The app keeps scores of legs, sets and also scores above 100, 140 and 180s. It also keeps long term average scores for the players.

I eventually hope to add functionality to the app to add new players, there is initially just 3 players saved in the app which

I have on my tablet and use when playing with friends.
